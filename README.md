## SoreUI usage
- First install the requirements (requirements packages might be broken if that happens try running the launch.py file for missing dependencies and install them after)
- `pip install -r failed_requirements.txt` install the 'failed_requirements.txt' because requirements.txt is a checkpoint not an actual requirements.txt
- Run the SoreUI launcher `python SoreUI/launcher.py`


This project has a lot of bugs, I look forward to contributions.
